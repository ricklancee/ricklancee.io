        <p>Explore Amsterdam was for an school project where the students had to design an app or website that used the information of the International Student Guide of Amsterdam. After a “concepting” process my idea was to create an app where users would be presented with a set of cards. On these cards where places of interest that the user could visit. </p>

<p><em>The application in use</em></p>

<p>Places supposed to ranked based on location so relevant nearby places would be on the top of the card stack. However due to time constraints and I was not able to include location based cards. </p>

<p>The application itself was really fun to make, cards where swipeable on mobile so you could dismiss them. You could favourite cards so you can find them later on again. One issue was that the library I used for swiping was nice, but it did not allow me to do certain animation that I would have like to incorporate into the app. Such as the card expanding on click. Next time however i will not opt for using a library, but rather create my own to solve the problem. </p>
