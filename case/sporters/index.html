        <p>The MOTI app was an mobile app that helped Olympic rowers stay connected an motivated with their teammates and coach. The goal of the app was to create something that would benefit Olympic athletes in journey towards the Olympics.</p>

<p>We wanted to create a simple application, one that was easy to use and didnâ€™t have too much complexity. We opted for only 3 main screens, the homescreen where users could see how the rest of the team was doing, a profile screen where users could see their own data and a chat screen where the coach and athletes could keep in touch with each other.</p>

<p><em>The main screens of the application</em></p>

<p>Everyday the athletes have to write down certain pieces of data about themselves. We as a team wanted to use this data in our application. In our final prototype users of the app would be prompted daily to input their data. However in a real world application this data could be transmitted through certain devices like a heart rate sensor.</p>

<p><em>Filling in daily data</em></p>

<p>The coach of the team could keep in touch and check up on the data of his team. He could decide if things were going OK, or when things were going poorly. </p>
