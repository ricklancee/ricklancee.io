        <p>Buddy is an app we created with 4 students. The goal of the app was to support patients of a chronic illness in their lives. As a group we chose to make an app for people with Social Anxiety Disorder. </p>

<p>We went trough a couple of iteration of the application and in the end we decided we would focus on a type of cognitive therapy called guided imagery.</p>

<p>Our app was indented to help with the at home therapy process. Users would use our app in combination with E-sensors that measure heart rate and breathing. You would use the app to give you feedback during your therapy sessions. The app would give you bio-feedback which tells you if you were getting stressed or not.</p>

<p>The final product didnâ€™t include actual sensors, these were faked for the demonstration. I would have liked to include these sensors in a working prototype however due to time constraints this was not possible. In the end i learned a lot from the prototyping tool Flinto, which helped us prototype the animations for the final product.</p>
