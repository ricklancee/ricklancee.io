        <p>For a class project we created a memory game where users had to remember where a prairie dog – the animal we chose – came out of his hole in the ground. The goal was to increase awareness and engagement of “hidden” animals. Animals that were not very popular with the general audience. </p>

<p><em>User would have to remember that holes where the prairie dog came out of to continue</em></p>

<p>The game constisted of 6 level which increased in difficulty each level on wards. It had a minimal requirement of two people. People played against each other and the person who was fastest would win.</p>

<p>Each level that you progress though you would move up a step in a virtual arena, you won if the reached the top. </p>
