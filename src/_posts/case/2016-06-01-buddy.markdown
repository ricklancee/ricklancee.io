Buddy is an app we created with 4 students. The goal of the app was to support patients of a chronic ilness in their lives. As a group we chose to make an app for people with Social Anxiety Disorder. 

We went trough a couple of iteration of the application and in the end we decided we would focus on a type of cognative therapy called guided imagery.

Our app was intented to help with the at home therapy process. Users would use our app in combination with e-senors that measure heartrate and breathing. You would use the app to give you feedback during your therapy sessions. The app would give you bio-feedback which tells you if you were getting stressed or not.

The final product didn't include actual sensors, these were faked for the demonstration. I would have liked to include these sensors in a working prototype however due to time contstraints this was not possible. In the end i learned a lot from the prototpying tool Flinto, which helped us prototype animation for the final product.
