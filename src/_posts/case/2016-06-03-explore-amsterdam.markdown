description: For The Internation Student Guide of Amsterdam I created mobile application to help internation students in amsterdam find places to explore.

Explore Amsterdam was for an school project where the students had to design an app or website that used the information of the Internation Student Guide of amsterdam. After a concepting process my idea was to create an app where users would be presented with a set of cards. On these cards where places of interest that the user could visit. 

<video autoplay="true" loop="true">
    <source src="{{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/images/explore/explore.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

*The application in use*

Places supposed to ranked based on location so relevant nearby places would be on the top of the card stack. However due to time contstraits and i was not able to include location based cards. 

The application itself was really fun to make, cards where swipable on mobile so you could dismiss them. You could favorite cards so you can find them later on again. One issue was that the library i used for swiping was nice, but it did not allow me to do certain animation that i would have like to incorperate into the app. Such as the card expanding on click. Next time however i will not opt for using a library, but rather create my own to solve the problem.
