Darkest nights was a short horror minigame that we (Bart van Dongen, Wesley HoÌˆlzel and me) made during a 3 day game design program at school. After some brainstorming we came up with the idea to make a horror game.

In the game you are "Tet", who is looking for his teddy bear, "Teddy" in the middle of the night. Since teddy is still a litle kid everything looks scary in the dark and his imagination runs wild. 

The game itself is pretty basic, on each level Teddy is hidden and you have to find him in complete darkness. After each level it will become harder, the rooms will be bigger and there are more monsters to look out for.

The monsters in the game can be stunned by shining your flashlight on them if your close, but they will continue to move a short time after you go away.

The game was really fun to make, Bart did the artwork in the game which turned out really nice, and Me and Wesley did most of the programming. The game was quite a success because people who played it were genuinely scared.
