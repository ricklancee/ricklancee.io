description: With a group of 4 we created a small memory game with the goal to increase engament with unpopular zoo animals.

For a class project we created a memory game where users had to remember where a prairie dog -- the animal we chose -- came out of his hole in the ground. The goal was to increase awareness and engagement of "hidden" animals. Animals that were not very popular with the general audience.

*User would have to remember that holes where the prairie dog came out of to continue*

The game constisted of 6 level which increased in difficulty each level on wards. It had a minimal requirement of two people. People played against each other and the person who was fastest would win.

Each level that you progress though you would move up a step in a virtual arena, you won if the reached the top.
