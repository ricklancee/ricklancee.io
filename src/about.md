┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ) Hi! 

My name is Rick Lancee, i'm currently an design student studying Communication and Multimedia design at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 

I like design, design that supports the user not the company. I like code, code that makes your web experience better, like progressive web apps. I want to learn more about a whole lot of things, design, code, tooling, application architecture... anything basically.
