`┬──┬ ノ(゜-゜ノ)` Hi. 

My name is Rick Lancee, i'm currently an design student studying Communication and Multimedia design at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 

I like design, design that focuses on users. I like code, code that makes your web experience better. I'm especially interested in things like [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). I want to learn more about a whole lot of things, design, code, tooling, application architecture... anything basically.

My current skills range from design, Back-end (PHP, Laravel), Front-end, some archictures and server infrastructure here and there.
